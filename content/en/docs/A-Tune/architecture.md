The following figure shows the A-Tune core technical architecture, which consists of intelligent decision-making, system profile, and interaction system.

-   Intelligent decision-making layer: consists of the awareness and decision-making subsystems, which implements intelligent awareness of applications and system optimization decision-making, respectively.
-   System profile layer: consists of the labeling and learning subsystems. The labeling subsystem is used to cluster service models, and the learning subsystem is used to learn and classify service models.
-   Interaction system layer: monitors and configures various system resources and executes optimization policies.
