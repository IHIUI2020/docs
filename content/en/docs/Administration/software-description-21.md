MySQL is a relational database management system \(RDBMS\) developed by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems \(now Oracle\). It is one of the most popular Relational Database Management Systems \(RDBMSs\) in the industry, especially for web applications.

A relational database stores data in different tables instead of in a large data warehouse to improve efficiency and flexibility.

The Structured Query Language \(SQL\) used by MySQL is the most common standard language for accessing databases. MySQL uses dual-licensing distribution and is available in two editions: Community Edition and Commercial Edition. MySQL is optimal for small or medium-sized websites because of its small size, fast speed, low cost, and especially the open source code.
