>-   If you select  **Virtual Host**, the virtualization components QEMU, libvirt, and edk2 are installed by default. You can select whether to install the OVS component in the add-on area.  

After the setting is complete, click  **Done**  in the upper left corner to go back to the  **INSTALLATION SUMMARY**  page.
