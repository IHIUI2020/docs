After the preceding environment configuration is complete, you can download and run the IntelliJ IDEA. The latest version of IntelliJ IDEA is incompatible with openEuler in some functions. You are advised to click  [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html)  and download the Linux package of the 2018 version. Move the downloaded package to the directory where you want to install the software and decompress the package.

```
# tar xf ideaIC-2018.3.tar.gz
```

Decompress the package, switch to the IntelliJ IDEA directory, and run the IntelliJ IDEA.

```
# cd ./idea-IC-183.4284.148
# bin/idea.sh &
```
