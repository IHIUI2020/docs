This section describes how to build RPM software packages using the OBS on the web page or with OSC. There are two methods:

-   Modifying an existing software package: Modify the source code of an existing software package and build the modified source code into an RPM software package.
-   Adding a software package: A new software source file is developed from scratch, and the newly developed source file is used to build an RPM software package.
