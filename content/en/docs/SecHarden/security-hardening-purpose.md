# Security Hardening Purpose<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0192977280"></a>

The OS, as the core of the information system, manages hardware and software resources and is the basis of information system security. Applications must depend on the OS to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, availability, and controllability of information. Without the OS security protection, protective methods against hackers and virus attacks at other layers cannot meet the security requirements.

Therefore, security hardening is essential for an OS. Security hardening helps build a dynamic and complete security system, enhance product security, and improve product competitiveness.
