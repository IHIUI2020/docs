# Stopping a Secure Container<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0184808171"></a>

-   Run the following command to stop a secure container:

    ```
    docker stop <contaienr-id>
    ```

-   Stop a pod.

    When stopping a pod, note that the lifecycle of the pause container is the same as that of the pod. Therefore, stop service containers before the pause container.
