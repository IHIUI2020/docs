The capability mechanism is a security feature introduced to Linux kernel after version 2.2. The super administrator permission is controlled at a smaller granularity to prevent the root permission from being used. The root permission is divided based on different domains so that the divided permissions can be enabled or disabled separately. For details about capabilities, see the  _Linux Programmer's Manual_  \([capabilities\(7\) - Linux man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)\).
